Nepal-Stock-Price-Prediction

In this project you can create a flask app to predict the nepal's stock price prediction system
In this project the dataset used as 2012 to 2017 as training dataset and 2018 to 2020 as test dataset
the algorithm used to create a model is:

supervised machine learning model which is linear regression algorithms
this project is for learning purpose and may not predict the accurate price regarding with current market price but you can learn to do

to start a project:

    clone the project from the remote repository
    create virtuall environment as: virtualenv
    Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
    first open the jupyter notebook by typing in cmd: jupyter notebook
    open the ipynb file and run all cells which will crreate a new model and save all script name in a text file
    run the flask app by typing: python app.py in cmd
