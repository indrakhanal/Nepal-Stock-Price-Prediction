# Nepal-Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project you can create a flask app to predict the nepal's stock price prediction system
 ## In this project the dataset used as 2012 to 2017 as training dataset and 2018 to 2020 as test dataset
 
 # the algorithm used to create a model is:
 supervised machine learning model which is linear regression algorithms
 
 # this project is for learning purpose and may not predict the accurate price regarding with current market price but you can learn to do
 
 
 to start a project:
  1. clone the project from the remote repository
  2. create virtuall environment as: virtualenv <env name>
  3. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. first open the jupyter notebook by typing in cmd: jupyter notebook
  5. open the ipynb file and run all cells which will crreate a new model and save all script name in a text file
  6. run the flask app by typing: python app.py in cmd
